## Features

### Experimental Tools

A sandbox world with multiple parameters to generate unique and random worlds.

### Rendering and Performance Optimizations

Switch between multiple rendering methods such as Unity's standard Instantiation, GPU Instancing, and Indirect GPU Instancing in addition to other parameters to compare performance differences.

### Random Noise Generation

Generate worlds with a mixture of different random noise algorithms and parameters. Currently only Perlin Noise is supported, but more noise algorithms will be coming soon.

## Dependencies

This project uses the following paid assets:
